Hi bunqers!

First of all I really enjoyed the assignment. It was lots of fun to create this chat app.

I did had some challenges on the way and I wish I had more time to make it more to my liking. However considering the time unfortunatly I have to stop now ;).
Hopefully you will get a good idea on what my skillset is.

In this file I would like to tell you my step by step approach with some challenges I came across.

1. Made the html set up with all the components that I will need.

2. Created the css styling. First hardcoded some conversations to get a clear view on how it will look like.

3. Started connecting the information from API into the chatapp.

4. Refactoring the code


a challenge is I think not working with a front-end framework like React. I am currently doing a course on React. However, I did not finish this yet so I don't feel confident enough to use this yet. After my 3 month course I focussed mostly on the understanding the fundamentls of javascript. I am deffinatly gonna do this assignment again when finishing the course and redo it in React!
The challenge with not working with a framework like React is for example that it's hard to keep track of the state. This is most evident in the fact that I wasn't able to save the chat in the browser within the time frame given.

Unfortunately I did not had time to add tests for this chat application. I was planning to add the test with cypress.

Thanks again for the oppertunity and I hope to discuss this further in the future.
